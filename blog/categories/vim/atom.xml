    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Background</h1>

<p>My first encounter with Vim was back in the year 2000, my first year of university. It didn&rsquo;t really appeal to me. Why on Earth bother with all these keyboard shortcuts when we have a mouse to point with?</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2008, my first PHP conference. The cool kids were all using one or another Linux flavor, and Vim for editing their source code.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re 2013 now, and while I&rsquo;ve been happy editing my source code in <a href="http://netbeans.org" title="Netbeans">Netbeans</a> for the past 8 years, I&rsquo;m not so happy with it anymore. Time to start learning and using Vim! (MacVim in my case)</p>

<h1>First things first: .vimrc</h1>

<p>Where to start? I&rsquo;m an IDE person and some things come with an IDE that don&rsquo;t come with an off-the-shelf Vim installation. Code completion, highlighting, folding, &hellip; Luckily these things can be added to your Vim installation by means of plugins.</p>

<p>Before we start adding plugins, there are some essentials first:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not here to tell you how to install Vim. Just google it. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/" title="MacVim">MacVim</a>.</li>
<li>Most, if not all, configuration of your Vim editor happens through a file called <code>.vimrc</code>. If it&rsquo;s not there yet, just create a file with that name in your home folder.</li>
<li>Plugins are installed in a special folder in your home folder: <code>~/.vim/bundle</code>, but more on that later.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the <code>.vimrc</code> config that I started with. It&rsquo;s quite basic for now, but I want to learn the basics first, and then gradually extend my knowledge.</p>

<p>``` vim
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on</p>

<p>set number          &ldquo; show line numbers
set lines=60        &rdquo; make the editor 60 lines tall
set columns=150     &ldquo; make the editor 150 columns wide</p>

<p>set tabstop=4       &ldquo; hitting tab produces 4 columns space
set shiftwidth=4    &rdquo; indent operations produce 4 columns space
set noexpandtab     &ldquo; don&rsquo;t replace a <tab> with <space>&lsquo;es
set softtabstop=4   &rdquo; amount of columns to use when hitting <tab> in insert mode</p>

<p>set history=1000    &ldquo; keep track of history for 1000 actions</p>

<p>set ruler          &ldquo; show cursorposition
set cursorline     &rdquo; highlight current line
set showcmd        &ldquo; display incomplete commands
set incsearch      &rdquo; incremental searching
set hlsearch       &ldquo; highlight searchresult</p>

<p>set scrolloff=4    &ldquo; keep at least 4 lines above or below the cursor</p>

<p>&ldquo; fileformat stuff
set fileformats=unix,dos
set encoding=utf-8
set fileencodings=utf-8,ucs-bom,cp1250,iso-8859-1
```</p>

<p>These settings won&rsquo;t do anything fancy. Just play with them and see what suits you best.</p>

<h1>Plugins</h1>

<p>Plugins extend the functionality of Vim far beyond its original capabilities. With the help of Vimscript, almost anything becomes possible with Vim.</p>

<p>The easiest way to install plugins&hellip; is with a plugin. Yes, <a href="https://github.com/tpope" title="Tim Pope on Github">Tim Pope</a> created a plugin, Pathogen, which allows you to install other plugins with almost zero configuration.</p>

<p>For installation of Pathogen, head over to <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen" title="Pathogen">https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen</a> and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>Add <code>execute pathogen#infect()</code> on top of your <code>.vimrc</code>, and voila! Now you&rsquo;re ready to install plugins.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s next?</h1>

<p>We now have our base Vim configuration: We have a <code>.vimrc</code> file in place that we can add configuration options to. And we are ready to install some plugins.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m learning and using Vim as we speak, I&rsquo;ll add more blog posts to tell you about my struggles, plugins I&rsquo;m using and other stuff I&rsquo;ve learned about Vim.</p>

<p>My goal is to stop using an IDE alltogether, and use Vim for all my source code editing. It won&rsquo;t be an easy task, but if others can manage it, then so can I. By blogging about my experiences, I hope I can help other people with their struggles.</p>

<p><strong>Update 20/09/2013</strong> It has come to my attention that the examples of supposedly lacking features are actually available right off the bat in Vim. They&rsquo;re just a bit deeper in the documentation. The things I should have mentioned were: git integration, auto-complete with the <code>tab</code> key, automatically adding closing angles, &hellip;</p>
